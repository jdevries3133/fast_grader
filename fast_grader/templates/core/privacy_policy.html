  <h4 class="my-2 mt-6 text-lg text-bold">Use of your Google Data</h4>
  <p class="my-2">
    This application integrates with Google Classroom and Google Drive. By
    logging in and creating an account, you grant us permission to access data
    associated with your google account.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    Your own personal information associated with your Google Account, like
    your name and email address, are stored in our secure database, and are
    never shared with third parties. Your username may be shared with third
    parties like LogRocket and similar analytics platforms for the sake of
    providing us knowledge about your use of the website and improving our
    platform.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    The functionality of this application requires us to consume data from
    Google Classroom and Google Drive. In these cases, we only save the data
    that is necessary to the functionality of this website, like course names,
    assignment names, student names, your grades, and your comments. This data
    is stored in our database, but it always belongs to you. You have the right
    to delete this data at any time, and upon deleting the grading session from
    your profile home page, it is immediately, permanently, and irreversibly
    deleted from our database as well. Security and privacy when dealing with
    Classroom and Drive data, in particular, is of the utmost importance to us.
    Student names are protected by COPPA, and will always be securely stored
    and never shared.
  </p>
  <p class="my-2">
    Our use of LogRocket to analyze your usage of the grading tool is the only
    exception to this rule, but we use a find grain of detail in specifying
    exact which content on the page is removed from LogRocket's view.

    class="link">For example, (click to see source),</a>
    inside the grading tool, we apply the <code>data-private</code> attribute
    to the student name on the page, which tells LogRocket to not record the
    content of this field, and therefore LogRocket cannot see the student names
    despite recording the remainder of the page.
  </p>
  <h4 class="my-2 mt-6 text-lg text-bold">LogRocket</h4>
  <p class="my-2">
    LogRocket will be used to analyze your usage of the grading app and
    continuously improve it. Most of the content on the page, including grades,
    comments, and student submission content is captured by this tool. However,
    we have ensured that LogRocket <b>will not</b> capture any student names
    whatsoever, so any assignment submission data it does have visibility of
    will be anonymous.

    Additionally, we will likely utilize these third party services on our site
    in the near future, although they are not implemented presently.

    This website is COPPA compliant, because any personal information about
    individuals under 13 years of age is provided by an adult who has the
    permission to do so. Any student information in our database (as defined
    under COPPA) is treated as sensitive data under the presumption that all
    students are potentially under thirteen years of age. Fast Grader uses
    industry standard security practices, including Transport Layer Security
    (TLS), and user authentication via Google.

  <h2 class="mt-6">Account Deletion</h2>
