  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p class="m-2">
    Fast Grader is currently in an early stage of development. As such, more
    analytics tools will be incorporated into the platform, and your use of
    the site will be analyzed in detail for the development of the project.
  </p>
  <p class="m-2">
    In particular, <a class="text-blue-700 underline visited:text-purple-700" 
      href="https://logrocket.com/">LogRocket</a> will be used
    to analyze your usage of the grading app and continuously improve it. Most
    of the content on the page, including grades, comments, and student
    submission content is captured by this tool. However, we have ensured that
    LogRocket <b>will not</b> capture any student names whatsoever, so any
    assignment submission data it does have visibility of will be anonymous.
  </p>
  <h3>COPPA</h3>
  <p class="m-2">
    This website is COPPA compliant, because any personal information about
    individuals under 13 years of age is provided by an adult who has the
    permission to do so. The only personal information of students that this
    service collects and stores are names. Student names are never sent to
    third party services, but are stored in our database.
  </p>
  <h3>Account Deletion</h3>
  <p class="m-2">
    Because this site is in an early stage of development, if you would like
    delete your account, please send me a personal email at
    <a 
      class="text-blue-700 underline visited:text-purple-700"
      href="mailto:jackdevriesmusic@gmail.com">jackdevriesmusic@gmail.com</a>
    so I can accomidate that request.
