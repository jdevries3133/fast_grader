    <h2>Important Note for Beta Users!</h2>
    <p class="font-bold">
      Currently, the beta build of the browser extension is undergoing the
      Chrome Web Store review process, and is therefore unavailable. At this
      time, it is impossiblbe to sync grades input on the beta site with
      Google Classroom until the extension becomes available. If you install
      the browser extension linked to above, it will only see grades entered
      on the normall site (<a href="https://classfast.app/">classfast.app</a>),
      not this site (the beta site).
    </p>
    <p>
      The review process normally takes 4-6 weeks, and feel free to reach out to
      <a class="link" href="mailto:support@classfast.app">support@classfast.app.</a>
      with questions or for updates.
    </p>
    {% endif %}
    <p>
      When you finish a grading session, grades are only saved to our platform.
      To sync them with google classroom, use the
      <a
        class="link"
        href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grade-sync-for-fast-grade/abjpdpjdpbcnpflodcknkiebmnglgikp"
      >Grade Sync for Fast Grader</a>
      browser extension for Chrome.
    </p>
    <p>
      This browser extension will open up Google Classroom in your browser, and
      input the grades for you. This tool is very new, free, and open source,
      so please take a second to double check the grades and kindly report any
      bugs (see bug reporting directions below)! Or, feel free to reach the
      developer directly at
        <a class="link" href="mailto:support@classfast.app">support@classfast.app.</a>

      <h3 class="inline" id="diffing">What does the "View Differences Only" Switch Do?</h3>
    </summary>
    <p>
      The "View Differences Only" button causes the website to grab the
      student's submission content, and the content of your original
      attachments on the assignment. Then, it produces a view of the
      differences between those two sets of content, so that you can cut the
      bloat out of your grading process, and just see what the student
      <i>actually did.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, it's really great for putting the focus on what changes the
      student made, which can turn a 3-page document, or a 10-slide Google
      Slide into a tiny text summary that fits on just one screen. By viewing
      only the students' changes, you get a very rapid and reflective view
      of their work, with less need to click, scroll, skim, and search for
      where they actually put those answers.

      <h3 class="inline" id="assignment-filtering">Why do some of my assignments not appear in the dropdown?</h3>
    </summary>
    <p>
      Only assignments that can be graded by this platform appear in the
      dropdown menu for choosing assignments.
      <img class="h-72" src={% static 'core/screenshots/assignment_picker.png' %} />
      The only assignments that pass the filter are: (1) assignments that are
      published, (2) contain a google drive file attachment, and (3) have at
      least one drive file attachment set to make a copy for each student.
