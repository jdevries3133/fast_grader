# Help

I am chunking the project into issues on the [issues tab
](https://github.com/jdevries3133/fast_grader/issues). Start there if you
want to help. Find something you can do, leave a comment on the issue, and
get started! If you are new to open source contributing, there are lots of
guides and tutorials to help you through the _issue => fork => pull request_
workflow, like [this one
](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions)

# What are we doing here?

Look in the `./design` folder for the plan.
