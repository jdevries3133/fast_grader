If you are excited about joining the team, let me know by shooting me an email
at `jack@mail.classfast.app`; I am always interested in taking on help from
anyone who is excited about this project! There is also an internal repository
containing documentation and planning docs, and I'm happy to provide access
for anyone looking to dive in.
