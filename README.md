# ‚ö°Ô∏è Grade Like Lightning üå©

**Grading in Google Classroom _really_ stinks.**

Let's say you are grading a google docs/slides assignment. The grading page
itself is a javascript behemoth that takes several seconds to load, then the
embedded google document itself takes additional seconds to load! Then, you
will sit around for even longer while the page glitches out as every image,
video, animation, and css file moseys its way on in to the page.

To add insult to injury, Google Classroom has no keyboard shortcuts for
advancing between assignments, entering the grading box, etc. It is a painful
point-and-click slog that plagues teachers around the world. The problem
is even worse if you are a music (me!), art, or other specialist teacher who
services a **huge** student body.

### When you give an assignment, _hundreds_ of students complete it.

Or, at least, you think they do ‚Äì¬†until now you haven't really had time to
check all that work, have you ü§î

## Features

### Super Fast

The app converts student assignments to plain text (the best kind of text), and
caches _all_ student submissions in your browser, so thay are **instantly**
ready when you are.

### Stable

This application uses the official Google Classroom and Google Docs APIs. It
is stable and built right, and as long as EdPuzzle or any of your other
favorite google classroom integrations keep working this one will too.
