# Teacher

As a teacher, I can grade with the keyboard, so that I don't need to deal with the slow google classroom UX.

As a teacher, I can view only the difference between the original assignment and student submission, so that I don't need to see extra content I provided for the student while I was grading.

As a teacher, I can move between submissions faster than I can in Google Classroom, so that I can grade faster.

As a teacher, I can learn keyboard shortcuts easily so I don't need to waste time.

As a teacher, I can grade quickly on my phone with a fast button-based UI, so that I can grade on the go.

As a teacher, I can use a similar button-based UI on desktop, so that I can use the platform if I'm uncomfortable with keyboard shortcuts, but still grade faster.
