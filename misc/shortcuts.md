# Keyboard Shortcuts

The whole idea of this app is basically predicated on keyboard shortcuts
to strip down the grading process to the bare necessities and make the
process very fast. If there is any point-and-click functionality, it will be
implemented later.

| _any number_     | input a grade                   |
