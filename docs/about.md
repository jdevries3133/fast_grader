# About These Docs

The purpose of this docs is to support contributors and integrators, to record
implementation details of the project for my own sake, and to create a portfolio
of the planning that went into this project.

Note that the documentation here is automatically deployed from the main
branch, so it doesn't necessarily reference the last stable version currently
in production. However, it should be in sync with
[beta.classfast.app](https://beta.classfast.app), and the corresponding browser
extension.
