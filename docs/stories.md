# Stories

A collection of user stories, with notes on how they _will be_ or _have been_
achieved. Stories should be written in the following form:

> As a `{ role }`, I can `{ do thing }`, so that `{ reason }`

## As a teacher...

> I can load and sync assignment and grading data from my LMS (initially, just
> Google Classroom, but later Canvas as well).

> I can input grades with the keyboard, so that I don't need to work with the
> slow LMS UI.

> I can view only the differences between mine and my students' attachments, so
> that I can accurately see what the student did.

> Interactive onboarding teaches me keyboard shortcuts and product rationale,
> so that I can use the platform.

> I can learn about the platform through social media / social media marketing,
> so that I can find and use it.

> I can learn about the platform through their blog, so that I can find and use
> it.

> I can learn about the platform through email marketing (for SongMaker users),
> so that I can find and use it.

## As a product owner...

> I can run the platform on on-premises hardware, to keep costs to a minimum.

> I can easily deploy the application to the cloud when it's ready to scale,
> without major code changes, so that I don't need to scramble to scale the
> application.

> I can offer a staging environment to opt-in users, which can also drives
> more communication with teacher users.

> Free users generate revenue for the website, despite the compute costs for
> their grading session, so that I can scale for unlimited free users and
> continue to earn profit.

## As a developer...

> I can run code changes through a robust CI/CD pipeline including system
> integration tests, so that I deploy less broken code.

> I can initially deploy code to a staging environment that is open to users
> who opt in to the latest and greatest.
