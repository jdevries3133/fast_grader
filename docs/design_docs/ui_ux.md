# Design Inspiration

- [good blog](https://kentcdodds.com/blog)
  - not necessary endorsing the specific brand for us, but it's outstanding
    UX for a blog
- [edpuzzle](https://edpuzzle.com/)
  - edtech company
  - has a unique look
- [flat.io](https://flat.io/)
  - music notation edTech app that I am familiar with
  - I've admired their design, especially recently
  - more serif fonts – I like serif headers. Although, they're channeling that
    classic sheet music look to align with their brand, of course

# Random Notes from Jack

- we are using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as a CSS framework for
  frontend styling.
  - note that easier implementation of design systems, and constraining the
    flexibility of hand-coded CSS is part of the design criteria for Tailwind,
    so as a designer, you probably can just make your design system, and I'll
    be able to implement it easily with Tailwind.
  - there are some videos that will help you see how tailwind supports designs
    and design systems:
    - [Translating a Custom Design System to Tailwind CSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZc4Jn5nK3k)
    - [07: Customizing Your Design System – Tailwind CSS: From Zero to Production](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0l0Gx8gWPHk)
- I was doing a bit of research today, and found that integrating Canvas,
  which is another Learning Management System, into the platform is doable, and
  definitely a future goal, because it has about the same sized user base as
  Google Classroom, therefore doubling the potential market share. As a result,
  **there is really no need to model our design after google classroom, or to
  align our brand with Google Classroom's too much**

# Tricky Implementation Details

There are some edge cases and detailed decisions to be made about various
aspects of the design. Some of these seem small, but have big implications for
how other things are implemented. Therefore, now is the time to think through
them in detail, because they are little things that can really back us into
a corner.
